# Bug: Board Text Area and "Add to Todo" Button UI Polishing

## Description
The UI elements in the Board view for adding tasks do not feel as "crisp" or refined as the chat message UI. Specifically:
- The text area is too large.
- The "ADD TO TODO" button is excessively big.

## Context
This was observed while interacting with the Board view to manage tasks. The current styling lacks the visual density and refinement found in the primary chat interface.

## Proposed Resolution/Investigation
- Adjust the dimensions and styling of the text area in the Board view to match the refinement of the chat input/messages.
- Reduce the size of the "ADD TO TODO" button to make it more proportionate and visually consistent with the rest of the application.
- Review the layout and spacing (padding/margins) to ensure a "crisp" and modern aesthetic.
